                over the last couple weeks preparing myself for the changes. Hoping my current job does not impede on my development at all. I can make sure I keep it from doing that. I took a short vacation this week to get my mindset right. Here is
                my daughter Millie looking cute at her first trip to the beach!<br><br> Hope I can get a group of fellow students together out of class to work on projects together and make sure we are all comfortable with the material. I find peer support

                that I have what it takes to stay focused and become proficient. So far I have been using SoloLearn to try and get some fundamentals under my belt before going into the program.
